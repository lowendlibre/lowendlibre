# lowendlibre

The freedom of postmarketOS (and other distros!), now on low-end MediaTek devices.

## Why?

[postmarketOS](postmarketos.org) is a great project, but it has a problem:

**There are very few devices that it runs well on, and the ones it does run well on are quite expensive.**

This project was created with a simple goal: Make mobile software freedom into something that's easy.

Initially, it was two separate projects the same goal - One was created by @hexaheximal, and the other was created by @JustSoup321.

However, on July 10, 2023, the two projects merged into lowendlibre.
